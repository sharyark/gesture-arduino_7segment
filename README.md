Overview
This project uses a webcam and the Mediapipe library to recognize hand gestures and display the number on a 7-segment display. The project consists of a Python script, gesture.py, which captures video from the webcam, processes it using the Mediapipe library to recognize the hand gesture, and sends the corresponding number to an Arduino board over the serial connection. The Arduino board then displays the number on a 7-segment display.
